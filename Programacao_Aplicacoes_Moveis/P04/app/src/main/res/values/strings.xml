The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure for human body
shape based on an individual\'s weight and height. It was devised between
1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet during the course of
developing "social physics". Body mass index is defined as the
individual\'s body mass divided by the square of their height. The formulae
universally used in medicine produce a unit of measure of kg/m2. A frequent
use of the BMI is to assess how much an individual\'s body weight departs
from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height. The
weight excess or deficiency may, in part, be accounted for by body fat
(adipose tissue) although other factors such as muscularity also affect BMI
significantly. The WHO regards a BMI of less than 18.5 as underweight and
may indicate malnutrition, an eating disorder, or other health problems,
while a BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight and above 30 is
considered obese.
