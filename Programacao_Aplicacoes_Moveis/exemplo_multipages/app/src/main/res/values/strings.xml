        The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure for human body
        shape based on an individual\'s weight and height. It was devised between
        1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet during the course of
        developing "social physics". Body mass index is defined as the
        individual\'s body mass divided by the square of their height. The formulae
        universally used in medicine produce a unit of measure of kg/m2. A frequent
        use of the BMI is to assess how much an individual\'s body weight departs
        from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height. The
        weight excess or deficiency may, in part, be accounted for by body fat
        (adipose tissue) although other factors such as muscularity also affect BMI
        significantly. The WHO regards a BMI of less than 18.5 as underweight and
        may indicate malnutrition, an eating disorder, or other health problems,
        while a BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight and above 30 is
        considered obese.
